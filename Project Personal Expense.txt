**Project Title:** Personal Expense Tracker

**Description:**

Develop a personal expense tracker application using Python to manage and analyze individual spending habits. Implement data structures to efficiently store and retrieve expense records. Integrate a database to persist the data for future access and analysis.

**Requirements:**

1. **Data Structures:** Utilize appropriate data structures, such as lists, dictionaries, or custom classes, to organize and manage expense data.

2. **Database:** Implement a database connection using libraries like SQLAlchemy or Peewee to store expense records persistently.

3. **User Interface:** Create a user-friendly interface, either using console-based prompts or a graphical user interface (GUI) library, to interact with the application.

4. **Expense Tracking:** Implement functionalities to add, edit, and delete expense records.

5. **Expense Categorization:** Allow users to categorize expenses into predefined categories or create custom categories for better organization.

6. **Expense Analysis:** Provide features to analyze expense data, such as generating reports, creating charts, and identifying spending trends.

7. **Data Visualization:** Employ data visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly to present expense data in an informative and visually appealing manner.

**Additional Features:**

1. **Budgeting:** Implement budgeting functionalities to set spending limits and track progress towards financial goals.

2. **Search Functionality:** Enable users to search for specific expenses based on criteria such as date, amount, or category.

3. **Import/Export Data:** Provide options to import expense data from CSV files or export data to other formats for further analysis.

4. **Mobile Application:** Consider extending the application to a mobile platform for convenient on-the-go expense tracking.
